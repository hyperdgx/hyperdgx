# Hi, I'm Hasrh Pawar 👋🏼


**hyperdgx/hyperdgx** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm Harsh Pawar, currently a student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at NRI Institute of Information Science and Technology. The word I like most is "curiosity" because I have the curiosity to learn new skills and tools for developing myself totally different and flexible than others. The power of imagination and making it true in your life is way better than harder than we think, therefore i'm filling up my space with my skills and some of my buddies to make it true one day.
