# Hi, I'm Harsh Pawar 👋🏼

I'm Harsh Pawar, currently a student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at NRI Institute of Information Science and Technology. The word I like most is "curiosity".

Currently, I'm working on building up my skillset. Instead of focusing on acquiring new skills, I'm concentrating on improving my HTML and CSS skills. Therefore, I have created my personal portfolio from scratch, hosted it, and am also pushing my limits by challenging myself with various technologies such as Java, Python, core concepts, and tools like Figma, simultaneously putting stress on my mind.

## Have a look at my portfolio 👀 <br>
