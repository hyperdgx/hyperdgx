# Hi, I'm Harsh Pawar 👋🏼


<img src="https://github.com/hyperdgx/hyperdgx/blob/main/Banner.png">

I'm Harsh Pawar, currently a student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at NRI Institute of Information Science and Technology. The word I like most is "curiosity".

Currently, I'm working on building up my skillset. Instead of focusing on acquiring **new skills**, I'm concentrating on improving my HTML and CSS skills. Therefore, I have created my personal portfolio from scratch, hosted it, and am also pushing my limits by challenging myself with various technologies such as **Java**, **Python**, **Core Concepts**, and tools like **Figma**, simultaneously putting stress on my mind.

## Have a Look at My Portfolio 👀 <br>
Hey, If you are visiting my portfolio website. Please, give some feedbacks. This will help me to improve user experience. <br>

## Look at my Skills ✨ <br>
I'm dividing my skills into two different categories. Firstly, as **Programming Skills**. Secondy, as **Software Skills**.

# Extras


I'm different from others; thus, I don't showcase the usual stats and trophies at the top of this `readme.md` file on GitHub. However, in keeping with my individuality, I've included them below for others to gain visual insight into my GitHub trophies and stats. I truly appreciate the work done to create this useful stat manager on GitHub and the developers & contributors made here.
